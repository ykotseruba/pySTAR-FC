[input_params]
; NOTE: provide one of the input options, not both!
; input - run on a single image, batch - run on every image in the directory

; full path to the input image
input = images/Yarbus_scaled.jpg
; full path to the input directory

[attention_map_params]
; BUSalAlgorithm - saliency algorithm for peripheral field (AIM or ICF)
; CentralSalAlgorithm - saliency algorithm for central field (DeepGazeII or SALICONtf)
PeriphSalAlgorithm = ICF
CentralSalAlgorithm = DeepGazeII

; peripheral gain - scales output of the peripheral saliency algorithm to compensate for foveation
; blendingStrategy - 1-SAR, 2-MCA and 3-WCA see the paper for more details (option 2 works the best)
; nextFixAsMax - if on, the fixation is chosen deterministically as the maximum of the saliency map
; 		 otherwise, it is selected randomly from the points left after tresholding (using the nextFixThresh)
; nextFixThresh - threshold to apply to the priority map before selecting maximum (only needed for nextFixAsMax=off)
pgain = 1.15
blendingStrategy = 2
nextFixAsMax = on
nextFixThresh = 0.95

; size of the peripheral attentional field in deg vis angle

; size of the inhibition of return in deg vis angle (set to size of fovea by default, not recommended to change)
; iorSizeDeg = 1.5

; decay rate of the inhibition of return (after how many frimes the fixation point disappear at that location)

[viewing_params]
; NOTE: provide pix2deg or inputSizeDeg option, not both!
; number of pixel per deg vis angle
; pix2deg = 38

; size of the stimuli in deg vis angle

; foveate - controls whether to apply the foveation transform

; viewing distance in meters
viewDist = 1.06

; total number of fixations to compute

; number of subjects to simulate (this option only makes sense for probabilistic fixation selection i.e. nextFixAsMax=off
; otherwise they are going to be all the same)
